# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Basic Improvement Flow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Capture user prompts, process them through GPT-4o, replace with improved prompts, and submit to AI models.
# Details:
The basic improvement flow has been fully implemented with end-to-end functionality, providing a complete, production-ready solution that exceeds the basic requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify functionality across multiple platforms and with various input types. Test error handling, loading states, and cross-site compatibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Capture User Prompts [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Collect and store user prompts from input sources.
### Details:
Successfully implemented with content script detection of text in input fields and contenteditable elements, getSelectedText() function, session storage integration for persistence, and event listeners to track user interactions.

## 2. Process Prompts Through GPT-4o [completed]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Use GPT-4o to analyze and refine the captured prompts.
### Details:
Completed with background script handling IMPROVE_AND_REPLACE messages, backend /improve endpoint processing prompts through OpenAI API, custom prompt templates in backend/src/prompts/improve.js, and comprehensive error handling for API failures and rate limits.

## 3. Replace with Improved Prompts [completed]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Enhance prompts based on GPT-4o output for better clarity and effectiveness.
### Details:
Successfully implemented with insertImprovedText() function that replaces original text, handles both selected text and input field replacement, supports textareas, input fields, and contenteditable elements, and provides visual feedback during the replacement process.

## 4. Submit to AI Models [completed]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Send the improved prompts to other AI models for further processing or analysis.
### Details:
Completed with direct integration with OpenAI GPT models, configurable model selection (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, etc.), temperature and max_tokens configuration, and demo mode for testing without API keys. Cross-site compatibility implemented across 13+ LLM platforms.

## 5. Advanced Features Implementation [completed]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Additional features that enhance the basic improvement flow.
### Details:
Successfully implemented message passing between content script, background, and popup, loading states and error handling, session storage for improved text persistence, and real-time text replacement without page refresh.
