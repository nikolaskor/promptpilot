<info added on 2025-05-26T14:34:16.193Z>
I've begun implementing the prompt tracking analytics system to monitor usage patterns and enforce freemium limits. The current extension uses chrome.storage.session for temporary data, but we need persistent tracking.

Implementation plan includes:
- Creating TypeScript interfaces for UserSettings and PromptImprovement data models
- Developing storage utilities for chrome.storage.local to maintain persistent usage data
- Tracking key metrics: usageCount, subscriptionStatus, lastResetDate, and prompt history
- Implementing the 20 improvements/month limit for free tier users
- Adding monthly usage reset functionality
- Collecting analytics on prompt performance metrics

Next steps focus on creating storage utilities (src/utils/storage.ts), defining type definitions (src/types/analytics.ts), modifying the background script to track usage, and implementing usage limit verification before API calls.

3. **Subscription Management**:
   - Mock subscription upgrade flow (for demo purposes)
   - Settings to manually change subscription status for testing
   - Premium feature indicators

4. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Graceful degradation when limits are reached
   - Clear messaging about what premium offers
   - Usage reset date display

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Update popup to show usage statistics and limits
2. Add proactive warning system in background script
3. Create subscription management utilities
4. Enhance content script notifications
5. Add usage dashboard components

**Next Steps:**
Starting with popup UI enhancements to display usage information and subscription status.
