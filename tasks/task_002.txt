# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define Chrome Extension Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Chrome extension structure with Manifest V3, including permissions for activeTab and storage.
# Details:
The Chrome extension structure has been fully implemented with a TypeScript and React-based architecture, using Vite as the build system. The implementation exceeds the basic requirements and provides a production-ready foundation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the extension loads correctly in Chrome, that all components (background, content scripts, popup) function as expected, and that permissions are properly configured.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create the basic file structure for the Chrome extension [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the essential files and folders for a Manifest V3 Chrome extension, including manifest.json, background service worker, popup HTML, and any necessary scripts.
### Details:
Created a comprehensive file structure including src/content.ts for content scripts, src/background.ts for the background service worker, src/popup.tsx for a React-based popup interface, src/index.html as the popup template, public/icons/ for extension icons, and dist/ for built extension files.

## 2. Define the manifest.json with Manifest V3 specifications [completed]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Write the manifest.json file specifying Manifest V3 format, including extension name, version, description, permissions (activeTab and storage), background service worker, and popup configuration.
### Details:
Implemented public/manifest.json with proper Manifest V3 format (manifest_version: 3), including permissions for activeTab, scripting, and storage. Added host permissions for localhost backend and configured Content Security Policy. The manifest properly references the background service worker and popup interface.

## 3. Implement minimal background service worker and popup scripts [completed]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create basic JavaScript code for the background service worker and popup to demonstrate the extension's functionality and use of permissions.
### Details:
Implemented a full-featured background service worker with message handling in src/background.ts. Created a React-based popup interface in src/popup.tsx with storage API integration. Added content script injection for multiple LLM sites in src/content.ts and set up cross-origin communication between components.

## 4. Set up TypeScript and build configuration [completed]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure TypeScript and the Vite build system for the extension.
### Details:
Successfully configured TypeScript for type safety across the extension codebase. Implemented Vite as the build system to compile and bundle the extension files into the dist/ directory, ready for loading into Chrome.
