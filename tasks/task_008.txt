# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Intent Selection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a dropdown for intent selection with predefined categories (Academic, Professional, Creative, Technical, Personal) in both the extension popup and on webpages.
# Details:
Implement intent selection dropdown in two locations: the extension popup (React/TypeScript) and directly on webpages (vanilla JavaScript). The dropdown should be positioned above the 'Improve Text' button in both interfaces and maintain consistent styling.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify dropdown appears and functions correctly in the extension popup
2. Verify dropdown appears and functions correctly when injected on webpages
3. Test that selected intent is properly captured and sent with improvement requests
4. Ensure consistent styling and behavior across both implementations
5. Test click-outside-to-close functionality in both contexts

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Dropdown UI Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the HTML and CSS structure for a dropdown menu to display predefined intent categories.
### Details:
Use a container element (like <div>) and style it to show a dropdown list of intent categories. Optionally, use the <select> and <option> tags for a simple form dropdown, or a custom-styled dropdown with <ul> and <li> for more flexibility.

## Implementation Plan for Intent Selection Dropdown

**Current UI Analysis:**
- The popup is built with React/TypeScript in `src/popup.tsx`
- Styles are defined in `src/index.html` using inline CSS
- Current layout has: title, subtitle, original prompt textarea, improve button, and improved prompt textarea
- Uses a clean, minimal design with system fonts and Google Material colors

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Add intent selection state to the PopupState type
2. Create a dropdown component that fits the existing design language
3. Position it between the subtitle and the original prompt textarea
4. Use a custom styled dropdown (div + ul/li) for better control over appearance
5. Include the 5 predefined categories: Academic, Professional, Creative, Technical, Personal
6. Style it to match the existing button and textarea styling

**Files to modify:**
- `src/popup.tsx` - Add intent state and dropdown component
- `src/index.html` - Add CSS styles for the dropdown

**Design decisions:**
- Use custom dropdown instead of native <select> for better styling control
- Match existing color scheme (#4285f4 primary, #ccc borders)
- Add hover states and smooth transitions
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels

## Drag Handle Implementation Completed

**Problem Solved:**
- Fixed the issue where clicking anywhere on the main button would trigger drag detection
- Users can now easily expand/collapse the widget without accidentally starting a drag operation

**Implementation Details:**
- **Dedicated Drag Handle**: Added a small circular drag handle in the top-right corner of the main button
- **Visual Design**: 
  - 16px white circle with subtle border
  - Only appears on hover of the main button
  - Smooth scale and opacity transitions
  - Contains rotated dots (‚ãÆ‚ãÆ) to indicate drag functionality
- **Improved UX**:
  - Drag handle has distinct cursor states (grab/grabbing)
  - Clear visual separation between click and drag areas
  - Immediate drag response when handle is clicked (no delay)
  - Proper event propagation to prevent button clicks during drag

**Technical Changes:**
- Removed drag event listeners from main button
- Added dedicated drag handle element with its own event listeners
- Updated CSS with hover states and visual indicators
- Removed click/drag detection delay since we now have separate areas
- Added `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent button clicks during drag

**User Experience:**
- Main button: Click to expand/collapse widget
- Drag handle (corner): Hold and drag to move widget
- Clear visual feedback for both interactions
- No more accidental dragging when trying to use the widget

The drag functionality is now intuitive and doesn't interfere with the primary expand/collapse functionality.

‚úÖ COMPLETED: Drag Functionality Successfully Implemented

**Comprehensive Drag System Added:**

**Core Drag Functionality:**
- Added drag state variables: `isDragging`, `dragStartX/Y`, `initialX/Y`, `currentX/Y`
- Implemented mouse event handlers: `handleDragStart`, `handleDragMove`, `handleDragEnd`
- Added drag event listeners to main button: mousedown, mousemove, mouseup
- Smart click vs drag detection with 100ms delay to distinguish between actions

**User Experience Features:**
- **Visual Feedback**: Widget scales up (1.05x) and changes cursor to "grabbing" during drag
- **Smooth Transitions**: Added CSS transitions for drag state changes
- **Boundary Constraints**: Widget stays within viewport bounds during drag
- **Hover States**: Cursor changes to "grab" on hover to indicate draggability
- **Updated Tooltip**: "Click to expand, drag to move" for clear user guidance

**Position Persistence:**
- **localStorage Integration**: Saves widget position automatically when drag ends
- **Position Restoration**: Restores saved position on page load/reload
- **Viewport Validation**: Ensures restored position is within current viewport bounds
- **Window Resize Handling**: Automatically adjusts position when window is resized

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Conflict Prevention**: Drag detection prevents accidental expansion during drag
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient position calculations and boundary checking
