- Transform vague descriptions into specific visual prompts with clear artistic direction
- Include artistic style references (cinematic, anime, photorealistic, abstract, etc.)
- Specify technical parameters: aspect ratios (16:9, 1:1, 9:16), quality levels, lighting conditions
- Add composition details: camera angles, depth of field, color palettes, mood descriptors
- Include medium specifications: digital art, photography, 3D render, illustration style
- Optimize for visual AI tools (MidJourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) with platform-specific formatting
- Encourage detailed scene descriptions, character details, and environmental context
- Use rich sensory language that translates well to visual generation`,

- Convert vague coding requests into structured development instructions with clear context
- Specify programming languages, frameworks, and technical stack requirements
- Include system architecture context, input/output specifications, and API requirements
- Add implementation details: error handling, edge cases, performance considerations
- Request proper documentation: code comments, JSDoc, type definitions, examples
- Specify desired output format: code blocks, pseudo-code, architectural diagrams, tests
- Include constraints: security requirements, scalability needs, coding standards, best practices
- Frame for debugging context: environment details, reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior
- Encourage modular, maintainable, and production-ready code solutions`,

- Include context about current knowledge level, course requirements, or academic goals
- Encourage step-by-step breakdowns, examples, and practice opportunities
- Request explanations of underlying concepts, not just surface-level information
- Promote critical thinking: comparisons, analysis, real-world applications
- Ask for study aids: summaries, mnemonics, practice questions, concept maps
- Ensure academic integrity: understanding over completion, learning over shortcuts
- Use encouraging, supportive tone that builds confidence and curiosity`,

- Specify desired analytical approach: systematic review, comparative analysis, theoretical framework
- Request evidence-based responses with citations and source quality indicators
- Encourage critical evaluation: limitations, conflicting evidence, research gaps
- Add context about research objectives, hypotheses, or theoretical orientations
- Specify output format: academic writing, literature review, research proposal, data analysis
- Include methodological considerations: sample sizes, controls, variables, statistical approaches
- Promote scholarly discourse with proper academic language and citation practices`,

GENERAL PRINCIPLES (always apply):
1. Clarify ambiguity and make the user's request explicit
2. Add constraints, examples, or desired format when missing
3. Preserve tone, topic, and core purpose of original prompt
4. Remove vague filler or verbosity — prioritize precision
5. Avoid hallucinations or inventing new context not implied
6. Use tone appropriate for the use case (e.g., formal for academic, friendly for personal)
7. Reorder for logical structure where needed
8. Output a prompt that gives the model everything it needs to respond with quality

⚠️ DO NOT:
- Add unnecessary length or complexity
- Fabricate assumptions beyond the original
- Break the user's intended function, topic, or tone
