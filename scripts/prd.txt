# PromptPilot Chrome Extension PRD

## Overview
**PromptPilot** is not just a Chrome extension — it's an **AI Prompt Operating System** that serves as an intent-aware prompt intelligence layer, optimizing how users interact with AI tools across different segments. Whether you're a creator working with MidJourney, a developer using Cursor, a student leveraging AI for learning, or a researcher collaborating with AI, PromptPilot transforms vague ideas into AI-ready prompts with precision.

The extension solves the critical problem of poor AI responses caused by inadequate prompts, but does so through a strategic, segment-specific approach that addresses the unique needs of distinct user communities.

**Core Positioning**: "Prompt like a pro. Whether you're coding, creating, or researching — PromptPilot transforms vague ideas into AI-ready prompts with precision."

## Strategic Use Case Segments

### 🎨 Creators (Image & Video Generation)
- **Target Tools**: MidJourney, DALL·E, Runway, Leonardo AI, Pika, Kaiber, Stable Diffusion

- **PromptPilot Solution**: 
  - Understands artistic styles, aspect ratios, quality levels, lighting conditions
  - Converts casual descriptions into production-ready visual prompts
  - Reduces creative iteration time from hours to minutes
- **Example Transformation**: 
  - Before: "a forest scene"
  - After: "Create a cinematic 16:9 anime-style forest scene at golden hour with dramatic lighting, ultra-detailed foliage, and ethereal atmosphere"

### 👨‍💻 Developers (AI Coding Assistance)
- **Target Tools**: Cursor, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, GPT APIs, Claude, Replit

- **PromptPilot Solution**:
  - Encourages use of academic language and systematic inquiry frameworks
  - Templates for literature review, hypothesis generation, data analysis
  - Tailors prompts based on research methodology and academic standards
- **Example Transformation**:
  - Before: "what does research say about remote work"
  - After: "Conduct a systematic analysis of remote work productivity research published 2020-2024. Structure your response as: 1) Key findings from peer-reviewed studies, 2) Methodological approaches used, 3) Conflicting evidence and limitations, 4) Gaps in current research, 5) Implications for organizational policy. Include proper academic citations where possible."
