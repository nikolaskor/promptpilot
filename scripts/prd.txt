# PromptPilot Chrome Extension PRD

## Overview
**PromptPilot** is a Chrome extension that simplifies and enhances prompt creation for users of LLM websites (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), making AI interactions more effective and accessible with a single click. It solves the problem of poor AI responses caused by inadequate prompts, targeting students and non-technical users who need better results from AI without learning complex prompt engineering techniques.

The extension provides immediate value by automatically improving user prompts before they're sent to AI models, resulting in more accurate, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses.

## Core Features

### 1. General Prompt Improvement
- **What it does**: Automatically enhances any user prompt for better AI responses using advanced prompt engineering techniques
- **Why it's important**: Most users don't know how to structure effective prompts, leading to poor AI outputs
- **How it works**: Intercepts user input, processes it through GPT-4o, and replaces the original prompt with an improved version

### 2. Intent-Based Optimization
- **What it does**: Provides specialized prompt improvements based on user-selected categories that align with specific use cases and desired outcomes:
  - **Academic**: Research papers, assignments, study guides, exam prep, thesis writing
  - **Professional**: Business analysis, reports, presentations, project planning, problem-solving
  - **Creative**: Content creation, storytelling, brainstorming, marketing copy, social media
  - **Technical**: Code review, debugging help, architecture decisions, documentation, tutorials
  - **Personal**: Learning new topics, decision-making, planning, casual questions, explanations
- **Why it's important**: Different purposes require different prompt structures, tone, depth, and formatting to achieve optimal AI responses
- **How it works**: User selects intent from dropdown, extension applies purpose-specific optimization templates that enhance context, specify desired output format, and include relevant constraints

### 3. Seamless Integration
- **What it does**: Automatically detects and integrates with popular LLM websites without disrupting user workflow
- **Why it's important**: Users shouldn't need to change their existing habits or learn new interfaces
- **How it works**: Content script detects input fields on supported sites and injects improvement functionality

### 4. Usage Tracking & Limits
- **What it does**: Tracks prompt improvements and enforces freemium limits with clear notifications
- **Why it's important**: Enables sustainable business model while providing value to free users
- **How it works**: Local storage tracks usage count, displays remaining improvements, and prompts for upgrade

## User Experience

### User Personas
- **Primary**: College students using AI for research, assignments, and learning
- **Secondary**: Non-technical professionals using AI for work tasks, content creation, and problem-solving

### Key User Flows
1. **First-time Setup**: Install extension → Brief onboarding → Select default intent → Start using
2. **Daily Usage**: Type prompt → Click "Improve" button → Review enhanced prompt → Submit to AI
3. **Intent Selection**: Access dropdown → Choose specific intent → Apply to current or future prompts
4. **Upgrade Flow**: Reach limit → See upgrade notification → Choose subscription or one-time payment

### UI/UX Considerations
- Minimal, non-intrusive interface that doesn't clutter existing LLM websites
- Clear visual feedback when prompts are being processed or improved
- Intuitive intent selection with helpful descriptions
- Prominent but non-aggressive upgrade prompts for free users

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- **Content Script**: Injected into LLM websites to detect input fields and add UI elements
- **Background Script**: Handles API calls, storage management, and cross-tab communication
- **Popup Interface**: Settings, usage tracking, and account management
- **Backend API**: Processes prompts through selected AI models and handles user authentication

### Data Models
```typescript
interface UserSettings {
  selectedIntent: 'academic' | 'professional' | 'creative' | 'technical' | 'personal' | 'general';
  usageCount: number;
  subscriptionStatus: 'free' | 'premium' | 'lifetime';
  lastResetDate: Date;
}

interface PromptImprovement {
  originalPrompt: string;
  improvedPrompt: string;
  intent: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  modelUsed: string;
}
```

### APIs and Integrations
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Primary model for general prompt improvements
- **Claude (optional)**: Evaluation for specific intents if cost-effective
- **Chrome Storage API**: Persist user settings and usage data
- **Chrome Runtime API**: Communication between extension components

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server for API processing
- **Database**: Supabase for user data and analytics
- **Hosting**: Cloud platform Vercel with HTTPS
- **CDN**: For extension assets and updates
